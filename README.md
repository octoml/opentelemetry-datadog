# opentelemetry-datadog
A fork of [`opentelemetry-contrib`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-rust) ported to
`opentelemetry` 0.8.0.

At time of writing the following are published:
- `opentelemetry` 0.9.0
- `opentelemetry-contrib` 0.1.0

But we are missing the corresponding version bumps in:
- `tracing`
- `tracing-opentelemetry`

Once those are out we can stop using this fork.
